# SupportVectorMachine
Support Vector Machines (SVM) are a class of statistical learning methods based on the principle of margin maximization (class separation). There are several formulations (linear, kernel versions) which can be applied to separable data (linearly) but also to non-separable data.
Project aims in comparing different formulations of SVM for better accuracy
